            <p>Currently, I manage the web site for the Ohio Association of Two-Year Colleges (OATYC). I primarily
              handle
              basic content updates a few times per year, but recently I moved the site to a new server which required a
              re-design from scratch. It runs on a new installation of WordPress now, so content updates are relatively easy to manage.</p>
            <p>I kept the design very simple overall since the site is rather light on content, but I focused on keeping it
              clean, minimal, and responsive. The original site was not formatted well for mobile devices, so I made that a priority with the re-design.</p>

        <h3>2018 OATYC Conference</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I served on the planning committee for the 2018 Ohio Association of Two-Year Colleges annual conference,
          held
          at Sinclair Community College.</p>
        <p>As the graphic designer for the event, I developed the logo, awards luncheon booklet, name tags, notepad,
          and
          multi-page program. Additionally, I assisted with creating content for and managing the web site used for
          the
          event.</p>
        <p>The grayscale logos are some of the variations created before deciding on the final look, shown in color.
          Mosaic tiles provided the inspiration for the segmentation within the lettering. I also created a version
          that
          utilizes a recolored image for the texture.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>This timeline was developed for a client who wanted to summarize for investors the history of a technology
          product that he had been developing. The intended output was a 1024px x 2248px image that could be emailed
          to
          his investors.</p>
        <p>The full timeline is displayed below. I have redacted the actual information shown since I am under a
          signed
          NDA, but I included it to show the layout and my approach to organizing the information.</p>

        <h3>2013 Faculty Learning Day</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In 2013, I was on the Fall Faculty Professional Development Day Committee (that year titled the "Fall
          Learning Day"), and I volunteered myself to design a logo for the event. Traditionally, logos had been
          developed each year by non-designers, and the results were usually less than spectacular.</p>
        <p>The theme in 2013 was "Beyond the Classroom: Educating for Life". I designed the header image below to be
          intentionally read in two directions: The bold text can be read vertically stacked as "Beyond Educating"
          while
          the colored text can be read horizontally in its two parts.</p>
        <p>The pattern behind the header was intended to evoke feelings of brain cells connecting as well as people
          networking together.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>For a period of time, I worked with the media team at Far Hills Community Church to create various slides
          that would be projected before the weekly services.</p>
        <p>These were mostly quick-turnaround Photoshop graphics, designed from stock assets found online. I developed
          the background textures and laid out the text. The logos were provided by another designer within the
          church.
