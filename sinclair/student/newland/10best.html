<p>•The color palette used works wonders for this site. The layout of the design is also great from a designers point of view. It flows well and uses a good grid system. However inside the menu bar the text is very large and somewhat over powering, and some of the text is smaller than the rest and looks like it was kinda thrown in there with the rest of it.
