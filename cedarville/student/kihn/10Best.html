<img class="best" src="Images/OneLastBeat.png" width="1726" height="929" alt=""/>
<p>Site Address: <a href="http://onelastbeat.com/" target="new">http://onelastbeat.com/</a></p>
	<p>Site Goal: To Entertain</p>
	<p>Target Audience: Young Adults</p>
<p>Navigation: Navigation is simple and easy to understand, Start button starts the video and the menu is easy to navagate with the about page having further instructions if needed</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: It was easy to use right off the bat, I did not really need to do anything to learn. I don’t imagine myself forgetting how to use this but if I did it would be simple to use it again.</p>
	<p>Content: I thought the content was interesting. To my knowledge there are not many things like this so I enjoyed going through the video</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: The design ad layout of the home page is awesome I really like the type he used it caught my eye and is ultimately why I went to this site. It had great contrast with the background and stood out well.</p>
<h2>2: 10x17</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/10x17.png" width="1563" height="929" alt=""/>
	<p>Site Address: <a href="http://10x17.co/" target="new">http://10x17.co/</a></p>
	<p>Site Goals: to entertain, to inform</p>
	<p>Target Audience: I think high school to college kids</p>
	<p>Navigation: relatively simple it took me a moment to realize I needed to scroll rather than click something. Otherwise the site was very consistent and easy to get around.</p>
	<p>Usability Issues: Easy to learn and easy to perform tasks, I may not remember how to use this one but could learn again fairly easy as I did before.</p>
	<p>Content: The content is interesting to me and I think others woyld find it interesting as well. I enjoyed seeing the different artwork that the people had designed and comparing it to what the albums really use.</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: The use of color was fun and caught my attention. Some of the layout choices were a little weird to me, only because I found myself getting a little confused. In the end this was a good website I liked its emphasis on both music and art and how it combined the two.</p>
<h2>3: Ruya</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/Ruya.png" width="1570" height="931" alt=""/>
<p>Site Address: <a href="http://ruya.ae/" target="new">http://ruya.ae/</a></p>
	<p>Site Goals: To promote, To sell</p>
	<p>Target Audience: Adults</p>
<p>Navigation: I was not very aware of what to do at first but after I clicked the first button It was easy, I enjoyed the animation between page transitions</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: I figured this page out quickly and after that it was very easy to use. I did make an error at first because I wasn’t sure where to go but after I learned it was easy.</p>
	<p>Content: The content was well written and interesting. They sold their brand well and seemed impressive</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: As stated above I enjoyed the animation between page transitions it was a nice touch. I also liked the bright colors and simple designs in the home page, they catch your eye but don’t distract you. The word “Hello” could have better contrast with the background or be placed in a better area. It seems to be the focus of the homepage but it gets a little lost.</p>
<h2>4: Wake It Up</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/WakeItUp.png" width="1700" height="930" alt=""/>
	<p>Site Address: <a href="http://wakeup.isadoradigitalagency.com/" target="new">http://wakeup.isadoradigitalagency.com/</a></p>

	<p>Target Audience: Buisness owners or people trying to learn web design</p>
	<p>Navigation: Once you get past the game and into the page it is very consistent, each page is similar but with new content. It is not descriptive of where the next page will take you but I didn’t find that caused an issue.</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: The game is easy to play and also I creative way to grab your attention. I liked how the game was in a way just bait so you would look at the real page</p>
	<p>Content: The content seemed well written and useful for someone trying to better their web design skills. It did seem like someone would need prior knowledge to do the things it was saying but I don’t think that was an issue.</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: The colors and animations of the game do eexactly what they are meant to do, grab your attention. As well as the page being well balanced and keeping you interested with the colorful fun pictures that were unified with the art style of the game.</p>
<h2>5: Pentagram</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/Pentagram.png" width="1516" height="928" alt=""/>

	<p>Site Goals: To promote, To sell</p>
	<p>Target Audience: Business owners, Designers</p>
	<p>Navigation: The menu for this page made the navigation a little weird. It was sort of its own page and the labels were a little confusing but it was usable just a little odd.</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: My only complaint is that some things that moved as you hover over them or the reactions to what you clicked on were a little overwhelming but it wasnt bad at all most things were interesting and all was consistent</p>
	<p>Content: Content was interesting and sight was attention grabbing and caused me to keep searching through it</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: Although it was a lot I enjoyed all of the animation throughout the site and the use of color to differentiate between topics.</p>
<h2>7: Paper Tiger</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/PaperTiger.png" width="2454" height="1246" alt=""/>
	<p>Site Address: <a href="https://www.papertiger.com" target="new">https://www.papertiger.com</a></p>
	<p>Site Goals: To promote, To sell</p>
	<p>Target Audience: People in need of designers</p>
	<p>Navigation: I thought the navigation was very easy. There is a menu aross the top which is easy to use. Also scrollin through the page is simple and esay to follow the page.</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: I found the site easy to use. It seems that transitioning from page to page is a lot of work for my computer because the site had long load times but that could be my own issue not the site.</p>
	<p>Content: The content was interesting and stayed consistent. I enjoy the white background with bright colors most other places. The text was written in a fun way but still got the pint across and interested me.</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: As stated I liked the use of color across this page. I also enjoyed how it was structured, other sites just have content all over the place but this was consistent to where it was and was easier to follow.</p>
<h2>8: Johannes Leonardo</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/Johannes.png" width="2452" height="1246" alt=""/>
	<p>Site Address: <a href="http://johannesleonardo.com" target="new">http://johannesleonardo.com</a></p>
	<p>Site Goals: To promote, To inform</p>
	<p>Target Audience: Designers</p>
	<p>Navigation: The navigation to this site was pretty easy. It was odd that when you hover over something it flipped the text upside down and abruptly opened an image in the background.</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: It was sort of weird how you transitioned from the opening page to the real home screen. Also, the hovering issue I mentoned, but beyond that it was easy to get from page to page.</p>
	<p>Content: The content was interesting but the wording was weird. It seemed well written but I had trouble under- standing a lot of it.</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: The designs were interesting I really enjoyed how the website was structured. I stand behind the hovering issue I believe that it caused a lot of issues with the layout, as well as the navigation and the us- ability overall, and the site would benefit without it.</p>
<h2>9: ESPN FC100</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/ESPN.png" width="2450" height="1248" alt=""/>
	<p>Site Address: <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/21589590/fc-100-best-men- players-managers-world-football" target="new">http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/21589590/fc-100-best-men- players-managers-world-football</a></p>

	<p>Content: The content was interesting and informative. Somebody looking for this information would majorly benefit from this sight. I believed it to be well writen and easy to understand</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: I loved the illustrations on the home page and how the images of the players and site in general stayed unified with them. I also liked the use blue and red. Those colors work well with eachother and it caused the site to catch my eye.</p>
<h2>10: Julie Bonnemy</h2>
<img class="best" src="Images/Julie.png" width="2360" height="1242" alt=""/>
	<p>Site Address: <a href="https://juliebonnemoy.com" target="new">https://juliebonnemoy.com</a></p>
	<p>Site Goals: To promote, To sell</p>
	<p>Target Audience: Those looking for a designer</p>
	<p>Navigation: I found the home screen easy to scroll through and follow. The menu was easy to use and I was aware of where it would take me. The project page was odd how it transition from project to project but it was not awful.</p>
	<p>Ease of Use: I found the site easy to learn and use for the most part. Usability would be my complaint on the project page. You must scroll to get through the projects but nothing scrolls the projects just change. I found that odd and did’nt understand at the start.</p>
	<p>Content: The content was easy to understand and had no mistakes that I noticed. I enjoyed how the designer described her projects with just enough information, she did not leave you wanting more nor did she bore you with to much.</p>
	<p>Design/Layout: The design was interesting. I found the lava lamp effect eye catching and not distracting since it was enclosed to only a specific section. At first I do not believe the sight reacted correctly and I found it weird, the text was not ledgible and the message she had written was very tiny and placed in an odd area. after I re loaded the page it made more sense. The message took up most of the screen with her projects listed on a light color font behind it. Once the site was displayed corectly I found it well designed.</p>
