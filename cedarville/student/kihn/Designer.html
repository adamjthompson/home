<h1>Featured Designer: Butch Hartman</h1>
<img class="butch" src="Images/Profile.jpg" width="117" height="117" alt=""/>
<p>Butch Hartman is an Animator best known for his shows he has created for the channel Nickelodeon. Those shows are Fairly Odd Parents, Danny Phantom, Tuff Puppy, and his most recent being Bunsen is a Beast. Although he more recently has only worked with Nickelodeon he has worked with many companies and channels in the past.</p>
     <p>He began his career learning at California Institute of the Arts. Through this he got the opportunity to be an inbetween artist for An American Tale. An inbetween artist is someone who  does the drawings inbetween the major movements of the characters. After graduating from CalArts he moved on to be a storyboard artist and character designer for the original My Little Pony. He soon left My Little Pony because of his inexperience with storyboards and moved on to other jobs.</p>
     <p>As his experience grew he got a job with the company Hanna-Barbera. They created many of the cartoons that showed on Cartoon Network in its early days. With Hanna-Barbera, Hartman helped with shows such as Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken and I Am Weasel. He also met Seth McFarlane, The creator of Family Guy, and they became good friends. McFarlane ended up naming one of his characters Dr. Elmer Hartman which is Butch’s real name. Butch also has voiced multiple characters on Family Guy.</p>
     <p>From Hanna-Barbera Butch moved on to Nickelodeon and began creating shorts for Oh Yeah! Cartoons. Hartman created a series of shorts for Oh Yeah! Cartoons called Fairly Odd Parents that Nickelodeon soon picked up as a series. The series started in 2001 and is still airing new episodes today. It is the second longest running show for Nickelodeon just behind Spongebob Squarepants. It also spawned multiple specials and animated movies as well as three live action movies that Butch Hartman directed. Although Fairly Odd Parents is Hartman’s most successful show he and many others would say his best work is Danny Phantom. Danny Phantom is my favorite of all of his work. It ran for three seasons from 2004 to 2007. It had a very original and throughout story. There was a lot of mythology behind the characters and the world they live in, which is the main reason I loved this show. His next show Tuff Puppy also only ran for three seasons and had mixed reviews through its time on Nickelodeon. His most recent show, Bunsen is a Beast, began in 2017 and is still airing new episodes. I find Bunsen is a Beast because rather than using traditional cell animation Hartman uses Flash which is more like a puppet you have the ability to move around. The art style also changes much more than his other shows. Each show is unique with its own style but still has slight similarities. Although Bunsen stands out from the others drastically.</p>
     <p>Aside from his cartoons Butch Hartman does a number of other things in his career. He created and runs his own interactive app called The Noog Network. This features more live action and animated shorts he has created as well as games for kids. He also started Billionfold, his own production company that produces all of his shows. In addition, Hartman created a comic book titled “The 3 O’Clock Club”. Along with all of this he runs a Youtube channel and Podcast where he talks about his life, career, and what is going on in the world. Lastly, He and his family started a non-profit called Hartman House that helps less fortunate families around the world.</p>
