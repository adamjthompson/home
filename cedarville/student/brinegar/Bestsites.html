    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s):</span> Plume is an adventure video game made in WebGL for Christmas Experiments 2018 opening. The site would most likely want people to play the game, like it, and help bring others to play it as well.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> The audience would be gamers, artists, possibly youtube gaming channels, and kids because the game doesn’t appear violent. This game would be for those who like puzzle, adventure, and story games. Also for those who like Christmas.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span>The navigation is very straight on. You are first asked what screen quality you want and then you are lead to the main screen above and just hit go to play.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The main menu has it where the mouse pulls your view around, which is unique and when you hover over parts in the menu, it pulls your mouse in, giving you a sign that you can click here.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span>The story cut scenes are straight to the point in telling you your mission as the character. The basic keyboard controls are w,s,a,and,d to move. But the rest is for you to discover.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> The layout is very detailed, but they use a very monochromatic grey. The theme of this game is Christmas, which is supposed to be a jolly holiday. But the reason it is gloomy is because the main character was forgotten by Santa, so the gloomy and dull atmosphere.</p>
    <p><span class="moreinfo"><a href="https://plumegame.com/" class="moreinfo">https://plumegame.com/</a></span><br>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s):</span> The goal of this site is to display a weird little story. I think it is meant to make people laugh and enjoy the little display they created.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> I would say the target audience is a little older than children, but not that children can’t use. The inside of the cabin leads me to believe this is a joke about people who take drugs.<br>
      <span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span> Fairly simple.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The use of the site is very smooth when it comes to going to where you need to go. Simple directions pop up, such as click and drag or click and hold. Nothing to complicated to understand.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span> Content is not really there. You have one simple designated point and that is it. You are lead to the cabin and can click out off cabin but that is it. That was a disappointment because I felt they could have added more.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout: </span>Other than the content to be a tad bit disappointing, the outside and surrounding area of the cabin is very beautiful. The use of complimentary colors yellow and purple are very astounding and very unique as an art style. What for me ruined it was the inside of the cabin with the elf. However, the elf can be seen as an element of its own. For instance,  the viewer goes from this soft and pretty art style to this extremely colorful and trippy area. But I took note of this because I liked how the beginning was set and the use of color</p>
    <p> for inspiration.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s): </span>The sites goals is to showcase artists work and their visual interpretation of others albums.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> The target audience would be artist, those who like primary colors, and album lovers.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span> At first I wasn’t sure what to do, but you have to scroll down for everything to appear. As you go down, information slides onto the screen.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use): </span>Finding where to go and scrolling for the links is very easy. The links light up when you hover over them so you know where to go. They are also very descriptive so you know if that’s where you want to go next.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content: </span>The albums are all labeled so you know who created them and they are displayed so no one else’s design takes up too much space. They have many different style show cased, so there is room for all kinds of inspiration.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> The color theme is my personal favorite, primary colors. Everything is well balanced in separate sections, but nothing is too different. You can tell that each section belongs together. But at the same time, there are different designs that are united by the same theme. This could be a way to organize a web site.</p>
    <p><span class="moreinfo"><a href="http://10x17co/" class="moreinfo">http://10x17.co/</a></span><br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s)</span>: I think the purpose of the site is more of a metaphor. That people have animalistic traits in their actions and the art </p>
    <p>shows this.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> Young adults, adults, artists, and those who want a good laugh.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span> The navigation is very simple, no clicking. You just scroll down and everything starts to slide in and display itself.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The site is very easy to use. If you want to go back and look at something, you just click a picture that leads you right back to where it is. You don’t have to click back and forth between links in order to find what you want to look at.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span> Content is there, but it is short and sweet. But when you think about it, most people don’t like to read that much. This page is also not super serious either, since what is said isn’t major or important, but just a lot of pun like quotes.<br>
      <span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> The color theme is mostly complimentary blues and oranges. Some content stays put as you scroll, which is a nice touch. Everything is simple and the font is easy to read and gets to the point.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s):</span> To sell and bring back polaroid cameras, new cameras, and accessories.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> Photographers, graphic designers, vintage item lovers, historians, and adults who grew up with polaroid cameras.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span>Traveling within the website is very smooth. Everything loads rather quickly and categories are labeled in such a way so you can find what your looking for. Nothing is too busy or complicated.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The different links are easy to access to go to where you want to go. They are a simple layout at the top, but you can still find what you need. The images also turn when you hover so you get a better look at the items you might want to purchase.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span>The items are labeled of what they are and how much they are for. The images also help when searching for what you want. They have an different categories of time periods of items too in case you want a specific product.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> The design is very straight forward. The site uses a great deal of photography of the products, so you know exactly what they are trying to sell. The font used is easy to read and when you hover over a link, the other links falter a bit so the one you are on stands out.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s): </span>To sell their product and advertise it.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> Adults who drink.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span> Navigation is very neat. You first have two links you can either click. One leads to the shop, the other has background information and recipes.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span> The use is easy because you don’t have to bounce between to many links to get to what you want. The links also have descriptions so you have a basic idea about where it will lead.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span> The website has information about the company and prices of products. They have it organized so if you want to read the backstory of the company you can.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> I like that the website uses both photos and video in their displays. The products are labeled so a consumer can easily find what they need to know. The overall structure is very well designed. There isn’t to little of information or content available. The photos are nice quality and the videos are very interesting.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s):</span> This site is basically a website an artist made showcasing what they have created and done to promote themselves.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> Artists, possible employers, and those who want to know more about the artist.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation</span>:You simply scroll down to look at the projects they made. You can also click from the top links to see other stuff the creator is up to.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use)</span>:The site is very easy to use and quick to load. The pages are easy to read and follow along what the creator is talking about.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span>The content is very interesting, including photos of the work that the artist has made. They basically summarize what they have done and talk about who they are.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> Although once more a simple layout, the most unique design to this website is that the creator uses the artist’s initials as a background element that appears frequently along with the artist’s name.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s):</span> To advertise and sell their product.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> Chip lovers, superbowl fans, kids, teens, adults, and those who want chips their way.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span>The navigation is very good.To make your chips is all in the front, giving a consumer a visual idea of how they would choose their flavors. Information links are quick to access as well.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The site is very playful, but easy to quickly use.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Content:</span>There is a wide range of content between different products they have available to more information about the company itself.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span> The design is very simple. Nothing very extreme, but the website works with elements of the chips and flavors by allowing the user to interact with items. The photos are high quality and the font is easy to read. It is plain in the beginning, but as you click onto the rest of this website’s pages, it does get a bit more information.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The layout is easy to read and offered in different languages so others can use the site as well. The links are easy to recognize and labeled well enough for someone to scroll through and find what they need.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Design/Layout:</span>The videos and imagery the website uses is very beautiful and symbolic. A soldier looking off into the horizon is very patriotic and helps a user give the idea about what the content will be about. The use of color is very bold as well with the black figure of a soldier.</p>

    <p><span class="smallheadings">Site Goal(s): </span>To showcase work in design that the company made, possibly to gain clients.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Target Audience:</span> Netflix watchers, graphic designers, possible clients, people who like that specific brand they worked on.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Navigation:</span> The site doesn’t really have a main menu, however a user can easily click and scroll to where they want to go. The images and text appear as a user scrolls up. The site is not filled too much either so a user can easily find where to click or look first.</p>
    <p><span class="smallheadings">Usability Issues (Ease of Use):</span>The site has legible text and not to much that is overwhelming either. The pages easily load so nothing is slow. Pictures are clear and easy to see.</p>
