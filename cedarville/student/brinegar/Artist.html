    <div class="bodytextregular" id="imageofpeople">David Catrow has over 70 published work in print, several NYT best sellers, and two NYT<br>
      illustrated best sellers. His scholastic book series, Max Spaniel, has sold over one million copies. Mr. Catrow has also worked in film and tv aside from his books. He has created visual developments for big films like Horton Hears a Who and Despicable Me. He has also done development work for Stuart Little on tv and Plantzilla. His work has also been run in over 1,000 newspapers in Canada and the United States.<br>
      Mr. Catrow has a website where you can book a school or library visit for him to come. He is very involved with the schools he visits, always having interesting things to talk about and has art examples to do in front of kids. He has commissions set up on his site as well for those who are interested in his work. He has visited numerous schools, Kenwood Elementary, which is my school being one of them.<br>
      He is a strong believer that everyone is an artist. He even explains further on his site how he believes that is so. His own art style is very unique as well, he is a self taught artist. <br>
      His characters have very exaggerated bodies and the illustrations are very smooth and clean. <br>
      His reported thought process in creating is “What if?”. Mr. Catrow plays with ideas that come to mind. David Catrow was born December 16, 1952 in Richmond,VA. He is still alive at the age of sixty six and based on his website, lives in Springfield, OH to this day. Before he was a illustrator and author for children’s books, he worked at the Springfield News-Sun as a Cartoonist. (Also, click David's face to go to his website!)</div>

    <p>I believe I was in fifth grade (I had my teacher both fifth and sixth grade, my school just did that?) when my teacher, Ms. Boyd, had my class write letters to him asking if he would be willing to come to my elementary school for a presentation. Only a few of our letters were sent to him, mine being one because I, being the classroom artist, was the only one who doodled on the bottom of my letter.<br>
      Before I knew it, Ms. Boyd announced that he was coming to our school. It was really cool. The presentation with him was cut into different groups so all grades got to go see him. Mr. Catrow talked about what he did and brought books with him to show and sell at the end of his presentations. The best part of his presentation was that he called kids up to help him begin a drawing. My group was the last he was presenting to, so he had all these big drawings laying on the floor from the past presentations. He would select someone from the sea of kids and have them draw a quick line. Then he would finish the drawing. I noticed though that most of what he drew was the same character out of different lines kids drew.<br>
      I wasn’t really in the front, so I doubted I’d be picked to draw, which I was itching to do. But then something only out of a story book happend: Mr. Catrow let Ms. Boyd pick someone from her class to draw. And that someone was me! I was so excited and nervous because I never been chosen in a huge crowd to do something before. They always pick people in front or the cute kids with dimples, not me!</p>
    <p>I was handed a marker to begin a scribble, just like everyone else. Maybe they thought I’d make a quick swish line or a s. But I actually surprised the man. Like the problem child I am, I started doodling, not thinking because I was so caught up in the moment of actually being called up to draw. He started to stop me, I guess he thought I didn’t understand what he wanted me to do, but Ms. Boyd started talking highly to him about my drawings and that I was the one who drew on my letter to him. So he watched me draw. I drew a dog running on a leash away from a stick figure man. I panicked at the end because of the eyes I felt in my back as I drew, scared I’d get scolded if I took up the poor man’s time. I handed back the marker and quickly went back to where I was sitting on the gym floor before, embarrassed.<br>
      Too my surprise, David Catrow actually continued my picture! He added a lizard on a leash running alongside my dog, coming up with something right on the spot. </p>
    <p>My classmates praised me for drawing what I drew, but I was just in shock. Later before leaving school, I saw Mr. Catrow in the art room with Ms. Boyd. They were talking as I was waiting for my mom by the office. She saw me and called me in there to talk with them, about what, I don’t recall. I don’t remember if it was me or ms. Boyd, but one of us asked if I could have the drawing we did together and he said yes! I went across the hall to the gym and got the big picture. I was so happy, I never got something from someone famous before. I even got him to sign my picture. My mom bought me a big frame to put it in to keep it restored and safe. I still have it to this day and although the frame is a tad dusty, the picture is fine.<br>
      I really admire David Catrow. He was very nice and seems to care alot about kids. Not many people enjoy what they do for a living, but he does. He deserves a lot more attention for his work. That day in fifth grade also made me realize that maybe I could have a career in art. He may not be a Graphic Designer, but he has had many different roles in jobs in his career. I would love to meet him again just to show him what we created so long ago together and say thanks for being an inspiration.</p>
