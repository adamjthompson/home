<h2> About Kate Moross</h2>
<h3> graphic designer, illustrator, art director</h3>
<p>Kate Moross is a graphic designer, illustrator, and art director based in London. She studied at Wimbledon School of Art and Camberwell School of Art, where she graduated in 2008. Since then Moross has spent her time adding her creative touch to music videos, textiles, identities, murals, fashion, and magazine covers for many international publications and brands. In 2012, she set up her own design studio, Studio Moross, which she set to focus on branding, art direction and commercial products. It was with her studio where she created all the tour visuals and art for One Direction in 2015.
</p>
<p>Moross has gone from creating profiles and posters for bands on myspace in her early days, to designing a nationwide billboard campaign for Cadbury in only her second year of college, setting up her own record label, collaborating with companies like Adidas and Kohls, adverts for Sony, Converse, Nike, American Express, and many more! Moross explains in an interview that she had a lot of visual stuff around her growing up. Her grandparents, who lived in South Africa, had a lot of art in their house. The art consisted of a lot of pattern, color, and geometry, which had a big influence on her, and something you can definitely see in her work today. Growing up with the internet and social media also had a big impact on Moross. She used the opportunity of knowing how to code to design. “For me is was never about about doing web stuff. It was always about creating visuals to go on the web.” From age 16 or 17, she had a website where she posted all her work, no matter if it was good or not. Then she was asked to pitch for Cadbury, which was like the set off of her career.
</p>
<p>Moross always makes time to do solo shows and give lectures. She’s done public speaking in various places such as Design Indaba, Cape Town in 2017, Pentagram, London in 2015, Visuelt, Norway in 2014, The Apple Store, NYC in 2014 and a lot more. She has also done lectures as various schools such as, Manchester School of art, Brighton University, South Downs College, and Camberwell College of Art.  Moross has won many awards and achievements, some including, UKMVA Award Winning Director in 2014 Music Ad Category, YCN Professional Awards Studio Moross Design Category in 2013, and ADC Young Guns Award Class of YGX in 2012
</p>
<p>Kate Moross is a loved and respected person because she works for what she truly believes in. Her love of color and energetic design style really makes her work stand out and be an inspiration to anyone who sees it.
