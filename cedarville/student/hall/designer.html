    <p>Saul Bass was an American graphic designer and Academy Award-winning filmmaker, best known for his design of motion-picture title sequences, film posters, and corporate logos. </p>
    <p>He was born on May 8, 1920 in the Bronx, New York to Eastern European Jewish immigrant parents. He studied part-time at the Art Students League in Manhattan until attending night classes with György Kepes at Brooklyn College. In 1938, Saul married Ruth Cooper and they had two children, Robert in 1942 and Andrea in 1946.  He began his time in Hollywood in the 1940s, designing print advertisements for films including Champion (1949), Death of a Salesman (1951) and The Moon Is Blue (1953), directed by Otto Preminger. His next collaboration with Preminger was to design a film poster for his 1954 film Carmen Jones. Preminger, being so impressed with his work, asked Bass to develop the title sequence for the film as well. Bass was one of the first to realize the creative potential of the opening and closing credits of a movie. For Alfred Hitchcock, Bass provided effective, memorable title sequences, inventing </p>

    <p>a new type of kinetic typography, for North by Northwest (1959), Vertigo (1958), working with John Whitney, and Psycho (1960). It was this innovative work that made Bass a revered graphic designer. Bass once described his main goal for his title sequences as being t<span class="italic">o “try to reach for a simple, visual phrase that tells you what the picture is all about and evokes the essence of the story”</span>.</p>
    <p>In 1955, Elaine Makatura came to work with Bass in his Los Angeles office. By 1960, with the opening to Spartacus, she was directing and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the two married, beginning more than 40 years of close collaboration. After the birth of their children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. They designed title sequences for more than 40 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects. From the mid-1960s to the late '80s, Saul and Elaine moved away from main titles to focus on filmmaking and their children. In the 1980s, James L. Brooks and Martin Scorsese, who had grown up admiring their work, rediscovered the two. For Scorsese, Saul and Elaine created title sequences for Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), The Age of Innocence (1993), and Casino (1995), their last title sequence. This later work with Martin Scorsese saw the Basses move away from Saul’s original techniques and move into the use of computerized effects. Their title sequences featured new and innovative methods of production and startling graphic design.</p>
    <p>Bass was also responsible for some of the best-remembered, most iconic logos in North America, including both the Bell Telephone logo (1969) and successor AT&amp;T globe (1983). Other well-known designs were Continental Airlines (1968), Dixie (1969) and United Airlines (1974). His corporate logos had an unusual longevity; they were timeless. Bass designed movie posters that changed the visuals of film advertising. Before Bass’s seminal poster for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), movie posters were dominated by depictions of key scenes or characters from the film. Bass’s posters, however, developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key elements of the film. He created posters for films directed by Otto Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, and Stanley Kubrick among others. His last commissioned film poster was created for Steven Spielberg’s Schindler's List (1993), but it was never distributed. Bass's film posters are characterized by a distinctive typography and minimalistic style.Bass was one of the most important graphic designers of the 20th century. His work embodied graphic design, poster design, film titles, logos and more – with perhaps his most iconic work being opening sequences for Hitchcock. His opening credit work spanned five decades – right up to his death in 1996. Some of his last work was for Martin Scorcese on Goodfellas and Casino. Bass also did some great work as a logo designer, designing the marks for AT&amp;T, Kleenex, United Airlines, Minolta and many, many more. He died April 25, 1996 in Los Angeles, California.  </p>
