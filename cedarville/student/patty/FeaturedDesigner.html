    <h1>Kate Moross</h1>
    <p>
Kate Moross is a contemporary graphic designer, illustrator and art director in London. She is well known for her typographic illustrations and being the art director of Studio Moross, which focuses on music based projects. She also has started Isomorph Records, which produces limited edition vinyl. Her designs follow a certain pattern such as shapes, illegible typography and she is fond of freeform lettering.</p>

<h2>Background and Education</h2>
<p>Kate Moross was born on April 09, 1986, in London, UK. Kate received her elementary and secondary education from South Hampstead High School where she first found her passion for art. During lunch breaks, Kate would go to the art room and teach herself how to use photoshop. To further her studies, she went on to Wimbledon University of the Arts, London. In 2008, she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree with first class from Camberwell University of the Arts.</p>

<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<p>Kate has accomplished so many things that young designers dream of. She has been profiled in Grafik Magazine, Dazed &amp; Confused, Vice magazine and Creative Review, who selected her for a Creative Future award in 2007. Kate also sat on the jury for the D&amp;AD Awards in 2012. Kate has had the amazing experience of running with the Torch in Lewisham for the London Olympics in 2012. In 2014, Prestel published her first book Make Your Own Luck: A DIY Attitude to Graphic Design and Illustration. She has written this book in an approachable and refreshingly honest tone, Make Your Own Luck features chapters on how to thrive in art school, develop your own style, how to self-promote, how to deal with "copycats," and when to consider working for free. Kate was also chosen to speak on stage with Tom Uglow from Google Creative Labs, presented by D&amp;AD, in 2014. Other various achievements by Kate include a nationwide billboard campaign for Cadburys, a signature clothing range for Topshop and illustrations for Vogue Magazine.</p>

<h2>Isomorph Records</h2>
<p>Kate has launched her own record label, Isomorph Records, for which she takes current music and repackages it as limited edition art vinyl. She claims it's the world's first art-driven record label. With each release Moross collaborates closely with the artists in order to create the ultimate visual representation of their sound, that brings together the band’s ideas and Moross’ vision for them. Isomorphs has both repackaged existing music and discovered and released original tracks. Kate accomplishes the limited edition series by never releasing digitally or printing over 500 copies, Moross describes these records as, "a series of artists prints that you can listen to.”</p>

	<h2>Studio Moross</h2>
<p>Studio Moross is a multi-tasking studio that creates art directs, designs, and films some of the biggest brands on the planet. They have quickly grown into two departments, Video Moross and Design Moross. Kate works with the most cutting-edge designers, the Studio Moross’ approach is exceptional: creating instantly recognisable and totally unforgettable artwork for print, packaging, moving image and branding. According to Kate, their board meetings consist of sitting around a big white board, which is like their shrine, to run through all of the projects that they are working on. Studio Moross has created iconic work for the companies of MTV, Disclosure, Sam Smith, Ray-Ban, Dreamland, Vice, Young Turks and One Direction among many others.</p>
