  <h2>Featured Designer: Marco Bucci</h2>
  <p class="marcobuccitext"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #6460A4;">Marco Bucci</span> specializes in illustration, film, animation, books and advertisement. He has worked
    for many companies, two of the larger names being <span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; color: #6460A4;">Walt Disney and LEGO</span>. However, he does a
    lot of freelance work nowadays. At a young age, Marco realized that he really wanted to be an
    artist, but he did not have the talent to draw. For awhile, he took a detour, finding interest in
    music and writing, however, the passion for art never left his head. In one of his videos on
    YouTube, where he gives advice and painting tutorials, I listened as he mentioned what it was
    like for him. Apparently, he wanted to become an animator. He talked about how at a young age,
    he thought achieving this goal meant learning the software and programs most importantly. He
    figured that keeping up to date on the latest animation programs would be what made him good.
    It wasn’t until he grew up some that he realized drawing was what he needed to learn to be a
    better animator, and thus his career as an amazing artist sparked. He also mentioned that
    programs evolve and change often, and taking the time to learn and dedicate all your time to
    software isn’t a good idea, as the current best program can change at any moment. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6460A4;">One should
      rather better their art, which will be a forever improving skill that defines your style and art.</span><br>
  <br>
    At the age of 19, he studied <span style="font-weight: bold">classical drawing</span>. He went into this field knowing nothing,
    but these courses kindled his love in illustration and just like that, it took off. Since then, Marco
    Bucci has had <span style="font-weight: bold">15 years of experience</span> in these industries. He has not only worked for film
    agencies, but also game and print industries as well. He primarily is a concept artist and
    illustrator. One of the bigger things he takes part in, is being an instructor at CMGA teaching
    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6460A4;">“The Art Of Color &amp; Light”</span> and also on YouTube, where he has a lovely and impactful series
    called  <span style="color: #6460A4; font-weight: bolder;">“10 Minutes to Better Painting”</span>. In this series he teaches about color theory, proportions,
    color harmony,  brushwork, shapes, the concept of light and much more. His videos are funny
    and very educational</p>
