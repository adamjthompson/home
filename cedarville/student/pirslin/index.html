  <h3><a href="#">What is SEO?</a></h3>
    <section>
      <p class="accordionedit">
<span style="font-weight: bolder">Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</span> is the practice of increasing the number and 
quality of visitors to a website by improving rankings in the algorithmic search 
engine results. 

SEO involves making sure a website is accessible, technically sound, 
uses words that people type into the search engines, and provides an excellent 
user experience, with useful and high quality, expert content that helps answers 
the user’s query. </p>
    </section>
    <h3><a href="#">Cascading Style Sheets</a></h3>
    <section>
      <p class="accordionedit">
Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once.

    <h3><a href="#">Hosting Websites</a></h3>
    <section>
      <p class="accordionedit">
Think of Web Hosting as a house where you store all your stuffs; but instead of storing your clothes and furniture, you store computer files <span style="font-weight: bolder">(HTML, documents, images, videos, etc)</span> in a web host.
More often than not, the term “web hosting” refers to the company that rent out their computer/servers to<span style="font-weight: bolder"> store your website</span> and provide Internet connectivity so that other users can access to the files on your website.
Generally, there are four different types of hosting servers: Shared, Virtual Private Server (VPS), Dedicated, and Cloud Hosting.
While all types of servers will act as a storage centre for your website, they differ in the amount of storage capacity, control, technical knowledge requirement, server speed, and reliability. </p>

    <section>
      <p class="accordionedit">“Good design is like a refrigerator—when it works, no one notices, but when it doesn’t, it sure 
The steps in designing a website are:
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder">Choose your platform <br>
        Homepage: decide on layout and menu navigation
        <br>
        Choose a theme / template
        <br>
        Choose a color scheme
        <br>
        Add your content: fonts, images and content<br>
Test, publish and update. </span></p>

	      <h3><a href="#">Usability Considerations</a></h3>
    <section>
      <p class="accordionedit">
The basic, yet central aspect of usability: <span style="font-weight: bolder">the availability and accessibility of your site</span>. If people try to access your website and it doesn’t work — for whatever reason your website becomes worthless. Here are a few of the basics of availability and accessibility: <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bolder">Server uptime</span> – It’s important to ensure your visitors don’t get an error trying to load your site. Invest in good hosting.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bolder">Broken links</span> – Double check that there are no dead links on your site.  Nothing sends a visitor back to Google search results faster than a 404 page. <br>
  Mobile responsiveness –  Make sure your site can handle different screen sizes and slow connections.<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder">Simplicity</span> – Focus on what’s important. If you don’t distract your vistors they will be more likely to do what you want them to do. <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bolder">Consistency</span> – Don’t get cute.  Create a consistent experience across your entire website to keep your visitors mind at ease. <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 800">Guidance</span> – Take your visitors by the hand. Don’t expect your visitors to explore your site all on their own. Instead, guide them through your site and show them what you have to offer.  </p>
